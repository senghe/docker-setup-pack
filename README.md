# Docker Starter

If you want to setup basic docker configuration for PHP and Symfony, this project is for you!

## Usage

```./console install project-name project-email``` - initializes whole project

```./console xdebug``` - starts or stops xdebug depending on its current state

## Software installed

- Ubuntu 18.10
- Apache2
- MariaDB 10.1.10
- PHP 7.2 FPM with xdebug (turned on by default)
- Composer

## Apache configuration

When installing project, you choose project-name. It's identifier for you application. For example, we chose senghe name. Now you have two steps to do:

- Put `127.0.0.1 senghe.local`into your /etc/hosts file in host system
- Put your web sources into public directory (already generated by script).

Now just build and start your containers, go into your browser and visit `http://senghe.local` page. It works! :)

## Configuring xdebug

Xdebug is configured to automatically detect connection. It's configured to work with PhpStorm. It's IDE key is PHPSTORM. If you want to change IDE key, just change it directly in xdebug config file.
