# Docker Starter

If you want to setup basic docker configuration for PHP and Symfony, this project is for you!

## Usage

```./console install project-name project-email``` - initializes whole project
```./console xdebug start|stop``` - starts or stops xdebug

## Software installed

- Ubuntu 18.10
- Apache2
- MariaDB 10.1.10
- PHP 7.2
- Composer

## Apache configuration

When installing project, you choose project-name. It's identifier for you application. For example, we chose senghe name. Now you have two steps to do:

- Put `127.0.0.1 senghe.local`into your /etc/hosts file in host system
- Put your web sources into public directory (already generated by script).

Now just build and start your containers, go into your browser and visit `http://senghe.local` page. It works! :)
